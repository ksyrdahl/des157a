                    <h2>A New Beggining</h2>
                    <p>
                        My first time driving across the Sacramento bridge was soon after the summer of 2021 when things started to look better. The bridge was glistening bright gold, with reflections of the sun's rays. I felt like I was driving into some heavenly realm. Its breathtaking architecture led my eyes down toward the capitol building which was framed in rows of skyscrapers. My jaw was glued to the floor, not because it was new or extraordinary, but because it felt like a new beginning to the life that had been put on pause in 2020.

                    <h2>First Date</h2>
                    <p>
                        Prior to college I had never dated anyone because I thought it would be better to wait  for college. However, COVID-19 threw a wrench in those plans for me, since it’s kind of hard to meet anyone when the only people you see all day are black squares on zoom, your roommates, and their cats. But then we got to go back to school in person, and I got asked on a date to the Crocker Museum.

                    <p>
                        The Crocker museum is a little bit to the right of the bridge and you have to drive over the bridge to get to the Museum. As we drove over the bridge, he started playing Ghibli music because I said I loved the movies. I still remember how nervous I felt driving over that bridge in his car wondering if I would need to use the pepper spray I had in my purse, but also excited to get to know someone new.

                    <h2>Railroad Museum</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of my roommates has been my best friend since the second grade. We have known each other for over 15 years and since neither of us have siblings, we consider each other the sisters we chose.

                    <p>
                        When we were little our school took a field trip to Sacramento where we visited Old Town Sacramento and the Railroad museum which is directly to the left of the bridge. We were so young when we visited the first time and didn’t remember much so we wanted to come back again to relive the memories. It felt very surreal returning after so many years and this time we also went with my new partner (the man from my first date story). It was the first time we had all gone on an outing together. It made me so happy to be spending time with two people that I loved and to see them getting along.

                    <h1>Love</h1>
                    <h2>Old Town Sac</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the scariest things for most couples is meeting the parents. Spring of 2022, my partner graduated from UC Davis and his mother flew from Japan, where he is originally from, and I got to meet her. Because of COVID my partner had not seen his mom in person since 2019, so they were both bursting with excitement. He made a list of all of the places in and around Daivs that he wanted to show her, his favorite being Old Town Sacramento. I still remember the look of pure joy on both of their faces as we crossed over the Sacramento Bridge. Him, excited to show his mom his new life away from Japan and her, excited to witness it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We ended up eating lunch on the waterfront so we could soak up the view of the bridge and river. Staring out at the Sacramento bridge she told us that this was the happiest she’s ever felt and she was so happy to see he had made a good life for himself.

                    <h2>The Picture</h2>
                    <p>
                        My partner and I have made many wonderful memories that revolve around the Sacramento Bridge and for this reason he holds a lot of love for the bridge. Anytime he sees something with the bridge on it such as a t-shirt or a sticker he has to buy it. We kept seeing these HDR images of the bridge in galleries around town, but they were all far out of our price range. So I decided last year for Christmas, that I would surprise him and take my own. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Photography is a passion of mine, but I had never taken an HDR image before. An HDR image is where you take multiple pictures on a tripod at different exposures and then you combine them. This allows for more detail in both the shadows and the highlights of the image. It sounds simple enough but I was worried I would not be able to pull it off. So of course my best friend had to come for moral support. We went to the bridge, found the perfect angle and sat in the freezing cold of winter as I took multiple pictures of the Sacramento Bridge until I ended up with the picture you see now. Now it sits up on a wall in his room, reminding him of all our memories.
