            <h2>Test Summary</h2>
            <p>I had three different people test my game without knowing anything about it. I asked them to "read the game rules," "Play one game all the way through playing for both player 1 aand player 2," "Start a new game, and click the help button," and "Quit the game." Below is the feedback that I got from watching their interactions.</p>

        <img src="images/rules.jpg" alt="Rules" width="244" height="300">

            <h3 class="num">1</h3>
            <div class="test">
                <h3>Observation</h3>
                <p>I noticed that my rules are too long. I was struggling with explaining the information in a clear and concise way and it took each user a long time to read the rules.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="backline1"></div>
            <div class="test">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Someone suggested that I number them which I think is a good way to make it less overwhelming. Someone also suggested that I bold the important information.</p>

                <h3>Observation</h3>
                <p>While picking an avatar, something I noticed is that some people went to try and click the image of the cats instead of the name button.</p>

            <div id="backline2"></div>
            <div class="test">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>I think I will make it so you can click the name button and the image to move on to the next page instead of just the name button.</p>

            <div class="test">
                <h3>Observation</h3>
                <p>There were some readability issues because of the background that moves. The white sections of the background were easier to read than the pink ones.</p>

            <div class="test">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>I might add a transparent white background behind the rules in the intro to make it more readable.</p>
