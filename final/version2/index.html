            <h1>House of Cats</h1>
            <p>There are too many cats in this house and they're bursting with energy. Help us get rid of some of their energy and choose which cat you want to play with to compete against your friend. During their turn one cat picks two cards. The cards have points ranging from 2-6. The total number drawn from the cards is then added to the current cats' score, unless either card is a "cat eye." If this happens, this cat's turn is over, and it is the other cats' turn.</p>
            <p>Oh, and if you roll two sets of "cat eyes", your current score gets zeroed out. So you want to avoid getting double "cat eyes." After each draw, the current cat can choose to pick a card again assuming "cat eyes" were not drawn. However, if you feel your cat might draw "cat eyes," you can also choose to pass to the other player so your score isn't zeroed out. The first player to get 30 points or higher wins.</p>
