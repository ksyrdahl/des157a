            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>I want to update my every picture project but instead of focusing on zoom on scroll I want to create images that move into frame on scroll, and possibly some that also zoom. </p>

                <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                <p>I want the user to leave the website feeling like they just left an art gallery. I want it to make them think about themselves, and the world around them. I don't want them to just leave feeling happy because they just saw something beautiful but to leave experiencing a wide range of emotions, and to be thinking about what the website was conveying.</p>

                <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                <p>I want this project to feel artistic and have a strong sense of motion. I want it to have a dark color palette as I believe this creates an artistic atmosphere in a design, with only slight pops of light color to create contrast with text and draw emphasis on the items I want.</p>

                <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                <p>My goal is to learn how to use more of the event on scroll feature in this project. In my original project I had planned to add more pictures that came in from off screen, but then I decided that this would make my website too busy and instead I simplified the design. I want to take that idea and use it to either tell the same story but in a different format or I want to tell a completely different story with some other picture I have.</p>

                <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                <p>I plan to mostly focus on “event on scroll” and “zoom on hover."</p>
